SkateGps

GPS parsing lib for the GTOP GMS-G6A GPS/GLONASS receiver

Please note that this lib is intended for use with the Arduno DUE and MEGA oard as they have more RAM and several Hardware Serial ports...

If you intend using the SkateGPS on the UNO or any of its equivalents then i would recomend utilizing the TINY GPS libs.
